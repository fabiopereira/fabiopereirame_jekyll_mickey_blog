<p align="left">A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a> set the challenge of an Android competition. Anyone from the Australian office could participate and write an Android app which would be presented and judged at the <a href="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/2010/09/12/teamhug-australia-2010-photo-booth/" target="_blank">TeamHug</a>. People should self organise in groups and each person from the winner group would receive an Android Phone as a prize.</p></p>
<p align="left">At that time, <a href="http://cuttleworks.com/blog/2010/12/thoughtferret-your-happiness-monitor/" target="_blank">Romain Prieto</a> and I were flatmates in Brisbane and we decided to accept the challenge. So we worked on an app called ThoughtFerret. Why Ferret? Hummm&hellip; Because ferrets look happy and they are cute and&hellip; That&rsquo;s pretty much it :) The objective of the application is to collect information of how happy a thoughtworker is at some point in time, using keywords and GPS location and... Well, let's make use of the "show don't tell concept"... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oyl8d8gMUg">Watch the video.</a></p></p>

Everyone present at the TeamHug voted and the winning criteria for the competition was equally divided in 5 topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact</strong> - Ability to credentialize ThoughtWorks with clients in the mobile app space or make a lasting impression.</li>
<li><strong>Originality </strong>- Innovation, revolutionary, have you seen this before?</li>
<li><strong>Presentation </strong>- Was it delivered well? Did they send the message across effectively? Engaging? Visually appealing?</li>
<li><strong>Usability and Usefulness</strong> - Can we use it now or is it still just a concept? Will it make your life easier, more enjoyable or speed up a process?</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - As Android development is still new, QA processes are still rather immature, how did you test your app?</li><br />
</ul><br />
Romain and I presented this app at the TeamHug and <strong>we won!!! </strong>Congratulations to the other teams, they were amazing!!! Here are the slides from <a title="ThoughtFerret Slides" href="http://www.slideshare.net/fabiopereirame/thoughferret-android-competition" target="_self">our presentation</a>:</p>

The prize chosen by us was the HTC Desire HD. Mine arrived 2 days ago&hellip; I can&rsquo;t stop playing with it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a pleasure working with Romain. He is such a talented person! He deserves the prize much more than I do&hellip; If this were a movie, he would have been the actor in a leading role and I would have been the supporting actor&hellip; :) <img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="fabio-romain-we-won" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fabioromainwewon.jpg" border="0" alt="fabio-romain-we-won" width="390" height="400" /></p>
