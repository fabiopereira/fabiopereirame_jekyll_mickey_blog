  content: "Dude!\r\n\r\nI've done a very similar thing on my previous project. The
    difference was that I used \"value\" instead of \"pain\" on one of the axes. I
    guess I prefer your approach better, because it's easier to answer \"Which item
    is causing the most pain?\" instead of \"Which refactoring would provide more
    value?\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing that was helpful at the time was using
    coloured-coded post-its for each functional area of the application (so you could
    see which area needed more attention). It was also nice to do the same exercise
    after some time to notice the difference. I will try and chase my notes/pictures
    and might write about it if I find them.\r\n\r\nI guess great minds think alike
    :-)"

    On the other hand, yours is based on years of playing experience plus thorough
    research into century old references. Feel free to point out what you think is
    wrong on my page and I'll find time to correct them. One trouble with the demise
    of Geocities.com is that my page is duplicated at multiple archive sites, e.g.
    geocities.ws, oocities.org, reocities.com and even on the internet archive site.
    All these archived pages will remain wrong till eternity because I have no editing
    privilege to these archives. -- CP Lai

<p>Although we should avoid as much as possible <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html" target="_blank">Technical Debt</a>, most of the projects end up incurring some of it. However it is important to know &ldquo;how much&rdquo; we owe and how much interest we are paying.</p>
<p><strong>Know your debt</strong></p>
<p>Recently on our project we did a <em>Technical Debt Retrospective. </em>Basically we brainstormed on the wall all the Tech Debts we thought we had incurred since the beginning of the project. Then we decided to categorise them by Effort and Pain:</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="TechDebtRetroEffortVSPain" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/techdebtretroeffortvspain.png" border="0" alt="TechDebtRetroEffortVSPain" width="526" height="455" /><a href="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/techdebtretroeffortvspain1.png"></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>&ldquo;The relative e<strong>ffort</strong> that the team would have to spend in order to pay this debt.&ldquo;</em></p></p>
<p align="center"><em>&ldquo;<strong>Pain</strong> is the direct impact on productivity that this debt causes. (interest)&rdquo;</em></p></p>
<p><strong>Keep paying down the principal, not only the interest</strong></p>
<p>If we do not pay down the principal of our debt by refactoring our code we will always be paying just the interest, which means reducing the productivity. The question we asked ourselves was &ldquo;Which ones should we pay first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the four quadrants of this wall we can identify which ones we can pay so that we can have the highest return.</p>
<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="TechDebtRetroEffortVSPainHighReturnNotWorth" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/techdebtretroeffortvspainhighreturnnotworth.png" border="0" alt="TechDebtRetroEffortVSPainHighReturnNotWorth" width="526" height="455" />One interesting thing that came out of our retro was that the <em>High Return</em> section was almost empty. We came to the conclusion that this was a good sign, it means that we had already fixed most of the LowEffort/HighPain debt during the normal development. Which is exactly how this type of debt should be paid.</p>
<p>After the retro we kept the <em>Technical Debt Wall</em> next to our Story Wall. From that day on it should become an ongoing wall that we will keep an eye on&hellip; Paying whenever possible&hellip;</p>
