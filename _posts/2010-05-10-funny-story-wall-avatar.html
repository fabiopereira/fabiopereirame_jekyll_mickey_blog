<p>No, I will not talk about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/" target="_blank">James Cameron&rsquo;s blue Jack and Rose new Titanic, aka Avatar</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><em>&ldquo;An <strong>avatar</strong> is a computer user's representation of himself/herself or alter ego, as a two-dimensional icon </em><em>(picture).</em></p></p>
<p align="right"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)</a></p></p>
<p align="left">Usually on our <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">agile projects</a>, we like to put up walls with <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/bigvisiblecharts/" target="_blank">big visible charts</a> and walls where we, and other stakeholders, can see what&rsquo;s happening. One of the most commonly used types of wall is a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?q=agile%20story%20wall&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi" target="_blank">Story Wall</a>, where one of the messages that we try to convey is <strong>who is working on what</strong>&hellip;</p></p>
<p align="left">One of the ways of doing this is to stick the name or a photo of the person (or pair) who is working on a particular story. One of my life and work philosophies is that a hint of fun in almost everything very seldom hurts, on the other hand it brings a new and better atmosphere to the environment. So why not put a little bit of fun on the story wall?</p></p>
<p align="left">My current team:</p></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.nigel.in/" target="_blank">Nigel Fernandes</a> had a goatee very similar to Ali G&rsquo;s.</p></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Prabin Deka</strong> has been using a scarf indoor, which reminded us a little bit of the posh Jude Law.</p></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ken Friesen</strong> is, obviously, Barbie&rsquo;s husband.</p></p>
<p align="left">And why is this <a href="http://www.google.com.au/images?q=fabio&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi" target="_blank">Fabio</a> supermodel so famous? I get that all the time&hellip; Damn it. :)</p></p>

<p>Try to be creative and come up with your own Avatar Selection Criteria&hellip; <a href="http://fragmental.tw" target="_blank">Phillip</a> told once that he likes to Google for images with the person&rsquo;s name and pick one from the first page&hellip; That&rsquo;s a good one as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, the rule is to have a bit of fun.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot the best Avatar on our project&hellip; <a href="http://lukestubbles.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Luke Stubbles</a> got his name misspelled as Stubbies&hellip; And <a href="http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/commercials/2008/1/l&amp;p-stubbies.jpg" target="_blank">here is his photo</a>.</p>
