<p>I just finished the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Yes-50-Secrets-Science-Persuasion/dp/1846680166" target="_blank">Yes! 50 Secrets from the Science of Persuasion</a>, in fact I finished <em>listening</em> to it I have been using <a href="http://www.audible.com" target="_blank">Audible</a> to download some audio books, it&rsquo;s really good actually. </p>
<p>One interesting metaphor in the book mentions that if we want to change one&rsquo;s behaviour, or if we want them to agree with us on some subject which is different from their current beliefs, it is like riding a running horse&hellip; Basically if you try to jump on the horse and at the same time steer him towards another direction, it&rsquo;s very likely that you will fall&hellip; However, if you jump on the horse and <strong>ride towards the same direction that the horse is going</strong> for some time and <strong>slowly steer him towards the direction you want him to go</strong>, then it is more likely that you will get some success. </p>
<p>Eventually you and the horse will be going towards a direction which is neither the original horse&rsquo;s nor the one you had in mind when jumped on it&hellip; Both will learn from each other what&rsquo;s the best way to go.</p>
