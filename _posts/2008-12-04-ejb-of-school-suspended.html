<p>My friend Ricardo Jun sent me a link to <a target="blank" href="http://codetojoy.blogspot.com/2008/12/child-suspended-for-ejb-taunt.html">this post</a> about a student who was suspended for calling his teacher the "EJB of school" and I thought that some drawing would make it look even better.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I did this:<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_MYvI118z088/SThg-wZVPgI/AAAAAAAAAC4/1Lsfy3kktzg/s800/ejbTeacher1_2.jpg" alt="Image" border="0" width="560" height="385" /></div></p>
<p>(...)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_MYvI118z088/SThg_81Dq-I/AAAAAAAAAC8/gA1wUgOP44w/s640/ejbTeacher2_2.jpg" alt="Image" border="0" width="576" height="481" /></div><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Check the <a target="blank" href="http://codetojoy.blogspot.com/2008/12/child-suspended-for-ejb-taunt.html">original post with entire story</a>. I actually don't know if it's true, but it's quite funny...<br /><br /></p>
<p>I've been thinking about telling my nephew and niece to call their teachers <strong>"the waterfall of school"</strong> just to see what happens...</p>
