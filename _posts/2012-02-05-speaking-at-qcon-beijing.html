  content: <a href="#comment-23731" rel="nofollow">@DC</a> I'll definitely talk
    about TTDD as one of the anti patterns that lead to useless and hard to maintain
    test suites mate... Thanks to your insight, I've learned the lesson :)

  content: In contrast, some emerging software disciplines such as extreme programming
    and the agile software development movement, adhere to a " test-driven software
    development " model. In this process, unit tests are written first, by the software
    engineers (often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology).
    Of course these tests fail initially; as they are expected to. Then as code is
    written it passes incrementally larger portions of the test suites. The test suites
    are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered,
    and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed. Unit tests
    are maintained along with the rest of the software source code and generally integrated
    into the build process (with inherently interactive tests being relegated to a
    partially manual build acceptance process). The ultimate goal of this test process
    is to achieve continuous integration where software updates can be published to
    the public frequently.

<p>I'm very happy to be a guest speaker at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qconbeijing.com/speakers.php" target="_blank">QCon Beijing</a> in April 2012.</p>
<p>I submitted the 2 abstracts below. We haven't agreed completely on the schedule, but it seems like one of them will be a half-day tutorial (Shallow Depth of Tests) and the other one a talk (Predictably and Irrationally Agile).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shallow Depth of Tests - Scalable TDD/BDD</span></strong></p>
<p>Test automation is prevalent in the software development community. Practices like TDD and BDD are widespread and applied almost unquestionably. However, several organisations have struggled in attempting to scale automated test suites, which very often become slow, brittle, non-deterministic, unreliable and difficult to maintain.<br />
In this talk, I will discuss some common mistakes, Tautological TDD (TTDD), for example, and also present patterns that I have successfully applied, such as Shallow Depth of Tests and Testing Pyramid. These have enabled us to achieve maintainable and scalable tests that fulfill their purpose - to help software development teams deliver faster and more confidently the features required by business people.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Predictably and Irrationally Agile</span></strong></p>
<p>People behavior is one of the centerpieces of Agile software development. Cognitive Psychology and Behavioral Economics have helped us achieve a better understanding of some human seemingly idiosyncratic behaviors, for example, the decoy effect on the decision-making process. Agile teams are constantly making decisions, for instance, while prioritising, estimating stories or choosing the size of an iteration.<br />
This talk will compare and correlate Dan Ariely's controlled experiments described in his book "Predictably Irrational" to Agile. The anticipated result should be an increased awareness of the reasoning behind some Agile values, principles and practices which, as a consequence, should improve the way we apply them as agile adopters and practitioners.</p>
