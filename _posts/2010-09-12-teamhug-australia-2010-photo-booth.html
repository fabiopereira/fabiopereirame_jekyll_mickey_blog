<p align="left">Just got back from an amazing weekend at the TW TeamHug. An event that happens twice a year and gathers people from all the offices in Australia plus some people from overseas. It was a record in Australia, around 150 people attended. </p>
<p align="left">Talks, party, great view, games, drinks... One of the highlights was a the photo booth during the wild west party night. Even Fowler went into the booth :)</p>
