  content: "Hi Fabio,\r\n\r\nThis is a great post that aligns well with the concept
    that Chris Matts talks about when he refers to <a href=\"http://abc.truemesh.com/archives/000735.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Feature Injection</a>. For many people who make use of User
    Stories, it's also the next step into realising there's a good reason for the
    format (and I agree that the best format is to put the why first). \r\n\r\nI'd
    also recommend people put \"What outcome\" vs simply \"What\" since it's very
    easy for people to confuse the \"How\" and \"What\" rather than talking about
    what objective they want to achieve."

  content: Although it is easy to say starting with why and then how and finally what,
    in real approaches, it is not simple. Do you have any idea to apply this rule
    for general actions and decisions in our life?

<p>You must have heard the old story about the fact that "it is always hard to find out <strong>WHAT</strong> the clients want"?<br />
And also if you are a developer you must have faced the problem of not knowing <strong>HOW</strong> to implement a particular requirement.<br />
A good approach that my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/67b/72b" target="blank">Kelly</a> came up with the other day was to ALWAYS ask <strong>WHY</strong> first.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://fabiopereira.me/img/blog/TWCard_WhyWhatHow.jpg" border="0" alt="Image" width="70%" height="70%" /></div><br />
Once we understand the client's needs, it will be much easier to implement the feature in such a way that will add more value.</p>
<p>The other big issue of not knowing WHY is delivering or even estimating "not needed requirements". For example, the other day we were estimating a Single Sign-On feature for an application that did not have any other app or even OS to share credentials... So, we asked: WHY do they need SSO? And then... Ding Dang Doon! (Thanks Dave Coombes and Ryan Moffat for the awesome onomatopoeia "Ding Dang Doon")</p>
