  content: I like this idea.  My only concern is that you're waiting until the retrospective
    to deal with the items.

  content: "I recently found out that a team of TW-ers of the India offices (Anand
    A. Chirag, Dhaval and Anay)have developed a tool for distributed retrospectives.
    Unlike Cardmeeting.com, you don't need to sign up for a meeting, you just create
    a new retro and send the link to all team members and people can start adding
    stickies.\r\nHere is the link:http://retro.play.railsplayground.net\r\nYou
    can choose what retro format you want to use, you can vote and the feature to
    club stickies in under construction. \r\n\r\nI have used it a few times now and
    it works well.\r\n\r\nI like the golden box though....:-)"

  content: "Hi Fabio, I noticed the same thing (during retrospectives people usually
    raise good and bad things from the last days only).\r\n\r\nSo I used to write
    post-it day-by-day for me but I was still thinking how to have this practices
    at team level. Think that Future Retro Box could be one good idea!"

<p align="justify">We have noticed on our current project that during <a href="http://agileretrospectivewiki.org">retrospectives</a> people usually raise good and bad things from the last days only. At the moment we have a 3 weeks iteration and it's hard to remember what happened on the first days. I have already used from 1 to 4 weeks iteration and each project has its own reasons for choosing this length. To help the team improve around things that happened during the whole iteration, we have a box called the <strong><em>Future Retro Box</em></strong>, where people can all keep adding notes throughout the iteration.</p></p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="DSC07729" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dsc07729.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC07729" width="620" height="465" /></p>
<p align="justify">The reason why the box is called <em>Future</em> is because it will be opened during the next retrospective. The items inside the box will bootstrap the retro wall when people can add other ones.</p></p>
<p align="justify">Make sure the box is in a visible point of the work environment.</p></p>
<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="DSC07731" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dsc07731.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC07731" width="620" height="465" /></p>
<p>Another option would be to have an <strong>on going retrospective wall</strong>, as suggested by my friend <a href="http://babbleburblebanterbalderdash.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Lachlan</a>. However, this might work better for a co-located team, we are distributed. We tried using a wiki for that&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t work&hellip; No one adds comments to the wiki&hellip; Why? Perhaps the wiki is a <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2009/01/lean-software-development-on-radiators.html" target="_blank">Refrigerator as opposed to a Radiator</a>. The box has been working fine so far. The notes are not visible, but the box itself is.</p>
