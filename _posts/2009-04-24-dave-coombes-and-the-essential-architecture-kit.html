<p>Yesterday was the last day of our so respected, funny, smart, awesome <a target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/davecoombes">Dave Coombes</a> at ThoughtWorks. He is not only a colleague, but also one of my best friends. So he will be missed a looooot.<br /><br />
We are working together on the same project and our team organised a couple of surprises for him...<br /> Well done guys!!! </p>
<p>Dave will be the architect of a big bank in Australia, so we've been joking around because of that... In a very good way, of course. So we gave him <strong>The Essential Architecture Kit</strong>, which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A portable white board</li>
<li>A ruler so that he can integrate systems by connecting them with lines</li>
<li>Architecture for Dummies (the book)</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br></p>
