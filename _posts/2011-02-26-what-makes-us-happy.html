<p>I have been reading a lot lately about what makes us happy. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hector-Search-Happiness-Francois-Lelord/dp/B004J8HWX2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298717115&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Hector and the Search for Happiness</a> is a very good book on the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hector-and-the-search-of-happiness.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-362 aligncenter" title="hector-and-the-search-of-happiness" src="http://fabiopereira.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hector-and-the-search-of-happiness-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" /></a></p></p>
<p>I found this list on&nbsp;<a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2011/01/hectors-list-of-happiness.html#comment-form" target="_blank">Jason's</a> blog and decided to repost. Thanks Jason.&nbsp;It also helps remind ourselves of what really matters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making comparisons can spoil your happiness</li>
<li>Happiness often comes when least expected</li>
<li>Many people only see happiness in their future</li>
<li>Many people think happiness comes from having more power or more money</li>
<li>Sometimes happiness is not knowing the whole story</li>
<li>Happiness is a long walk in beautiful, unfamiliar mountains</li>
<li>It's a mistake to think that happiness is the goal</li>
<li>Happiness is being with the people you love; unhappiness is being separated from the people you love</li>
<li>Happiness is knowing that your family lacks for nothing</li>
<li>Happiness is doing a job you love</li>
<li>Happiness is having a home and a garden of your own</li>
<li>It's harder to be happy in a country run by bad people</li>
<li>Happiness is feeling useful to others</li>
<li>Happiness is to be loved for exactly who you are (People are kinder to a child who smiles)</li>
<li>Happiness comes when you feel truly alive</li>
<li>Happiness is knowing how to celebrate</li>
<li>Happiness is caring about the happiness of those you love</li>
<li>Happiness is not attaching too much importance to what other people think</li>
<li>The sun and the sea make everybody happy</li>
<li>Happiness is a certain way of seeing things</li>
<li>Rivalry poisons happiness</li>
<li>Women care more than men about making others happy</li>
<li>Happiness means making sure that those around you are happy</li><br />
</ol></p>
