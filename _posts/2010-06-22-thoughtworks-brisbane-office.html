<p>A ThoughtWorks office in Brisbane was officially opened last week. We had already had an office in Brisbane, but it&rsquo;s been closed and now we reopened it. </p>
<p>Trevor, our CEO came to cut the ribbon. We had a Declaration of Independency from Sydney and Melbourne offices and at the restaurant I had snails for the first time, with Romain&rsquo;s and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/dannimcbride?ref=ts" target="_blank">Danni</a>&rsquo;s support :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still based in Sydney, but assigned to a project in Brisbane for around 3 months. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it, especially because of the great people we have here.</p>
<p>Go Brisbane!!! Thanks Danni and Super Dooper Dan Gower for the help setting up the office.</p>
